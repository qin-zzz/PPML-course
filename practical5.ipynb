We consider that all participants are honest-but-curious, which corresponds to $\\rho=1$ in the paper. The proposed approach relies on the Gaussian mechanism. As can be seen from Algorithm 1 in the paper, the idea is that each participant will add Gaussian noise $\\eta_i\\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,\\sigma_\\eta^2)$ to its local value, but also some *correlated* Gaussian noise terms $\\Delta_{i,j}\\sim\\mathcal{N}(0,\\sigma_\\Delta^2)$ with other participants $j$ such that $\\Delta_{i,j}=-\\Delta_{j,i}$. We consider for simplicity that all pairs of participants will exchange such correlated noise (corresponding to a complete graph of exchanges).
